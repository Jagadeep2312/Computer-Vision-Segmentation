# 🧠 Computer Vision – Image Segmentation & Emotion Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Computer Vision fundamentals**, specifically **image segmentation** and **emotion detection** using a labeled image dataset.
It demonstrates how machines can analyze images, segment meaningful regions, and predict **human emotions** from facial expressions.

The project is implemented using **Python and Jupyter Notebook**, making it ideal for **students and beginners** in Computer Vision.

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses a custom **emotion-based image dataset** stored in a ZIP file.

**Dataset includes:**

* Facial images categorized by emotions
* Emotion labels such as:

  * Happy
  * Sad
  * Angry
  * Neutral
  * Surprise (depending on dataset)

File:

```
EMOTIONS.zip
```
